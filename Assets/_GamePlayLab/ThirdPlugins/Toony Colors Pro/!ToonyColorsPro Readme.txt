UPDATE NOTES
------------
v2.11.2
- Mobile shader now compiles to shader model 2 as it was supposed to
- added menu options to unpack all mobile and desktop variant shaders

v2.11.1
- improved detection of manually modified generated shaders
- fixed issue with Shader Generator and Texture Ramp
- fixed issue with Shader Generator and Cartoon Specular

v2.11
- fixed issue with Shader Generator and TCP2 Lightmap
- added script to convert materials from TCP1 to TCP2 (in the tools menu)

v2.10
- fixed issue with Smoothed Normals Utility and built-in meshes
- Smoothed Normals Utility no longer requires mesh to be read/write enabled

v2.091
- fixed generated Shader userData not always saved when using Shader Generator

v2.09
- added option to render outline behind the model (Shader Generator)
- fixed shader model 2 outlines with Shader Generator (Unity 4.5)

v2.08
- fixed Parallax offset for diffuse texture (Shader Generator)
- fixed warnings on package import (Unity 5)
- TCP2 shaders now work correctly with Substance materials (Unity 5)

v2.07
- fixed MatCap calculations (was incorrect with rotated meshes) in Mobile shaders and Shader Generator template

v2.06
- fixed MatCap issue with scaled skinned meshes (added option to turn fix on/off in inspector)
- fixed Pixel MatCap breaking generated shaders if normal map was disabled

v2.05
- added Pixel Matcap option in Shader Generator, allows MatCap to work with normal maps

v2.04
- fixed path issues on Mac

v2.03
- fixed glitched outlines in DX11

v2.02
- fixed issue with vertex function in generated shaders
- removed debug information showing in material inspector

v2.01
- updated Mobile shaders to target shader model 3: should fix compilation issues with some combinations, will break compatibility with super old desktop GPU (roughly pre-2004)

v2.0
- everything redone from scratch!
- lots of new features and optimizations added to the shaders
- Unified Inspector: select one shader and then let the inspector choose the correct optimized shader for you
- Shader Generator: generate your own stylized shader choosing from a lot of features

v1.7
- added alpha output to shader files (RenderTextures should now work for real)
- Constant Outline shaders now take the object's uniform scale into account

v1.6
- fixed alpha output to 0 in lighting model, would cause problems with Render Textures previously
- fixed Warnings in Unity 4+ versions
- fixed shader Warnings for D3D11 and D3D11_9X compilers
- re-enabled ZWrite by default for outlines, would cause them to not show over skyboxes previously

v1.5

v1.4

- changed name to "Toony Colors"
- fixed Bump Maps Substance compatibility (WARNING: you may have to re-set the Normal Maps in your materials)
